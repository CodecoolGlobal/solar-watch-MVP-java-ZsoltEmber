SolarWatch API
SolarWatch is a Spring Boot Web API project designed to provide sunrise and sunset times for a given city on a specified date, in either local or UTC times. This project will guide you through the development and management of web applications within the Spring Boot platform, starting from scratch.

Project Overview
Our development approach for SolarWatch will be structured as follows:

Minimal Viable Product (MVP): Initially, we'll implement basic functionality in a simple manner to establish the core features of the application.
Containerization: In the subsequent weeks, we'll containerize the application using Docker.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): We'll enable a CI/CD workflow to streamline the project's development process.
Database Integration: We'll incorporate a database using Spring Data, a comprehensive project that encompasses various subprojects tailored for specific databases.
Feature Development: Once the infrastructure and development workflow are set up, we'll focus on fully developing the application's features.
Frontend Development
In parallel with the API development, a separate frontend project will be built using React. This frontend will communicate with the SolarWatch API to display the results in a user-friendly interface.
